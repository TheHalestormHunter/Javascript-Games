What do you think? 


I am writing to formally notify you of my resignation from my position at TekSystems. I was recently offered a new opportunity with a company closer to home and have decided to take their offer. 

Currently I spend almost 2 hours commuting each day and this new opportunity will allow me to cut my travel time by over half. My last day of employment with TekSystems will be December 7th.

My year at TaxAct has been one of the best years of my life. I will miss my job and the incredible people I have had the pleasure of working with throughout the years. 

I cannot thank you enough for all the opportunities and experiences you have provided me during my time with the company. 

I appreciate your support and understanding, and I wish you all the very best. Please let me know if I can be of any assistance during the last few days of my time here. 

Sincerely, 

Travis Grosch
