
Unfortunately at this time we're unable to see the pricing of 2018 returns. We expect this functionality to roll over from the 2017 tax year in the upcoming weeks, however for the time being we advise you check the price yourself from the "My Taxes" page. Below are some step by step instructions to do so:

Sign into your TaxAct account, Here
Click the Box in the lower right hand corner labeled "My Taxes"
Click the Drop down-arrow to the left of the return in question
The price will be displayed in the drop down menu.
To ensure you do receive your discounted rate, I have also notated the account with the discount that should have been applied, and if you see a different price at the time of filing simply reply to this email, or give us a call and we'll be happy to adjust it.
